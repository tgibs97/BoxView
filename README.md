## Inspiration

To make the consumer experience more seamless and streamlined as well as to enable the consumer to well-informed when purchasing movies or video games.

## What it does

The application scans an image of the product and replaces the image with other media containing more information about the product.

## How we built it

Using Unity with the Vuforia API, we created a digital environment that can scan box art and retrieve the corresponding media from a server.

## Challenges
We initially wanted to implement the cloud server method of Vueforia's API. However, Unity is no longer compatible with Vuforia's cloud server framework.

## Project Accomplishments 

Hosting the trailers in a separate web server. Successfully identifying box art and replacing it with the corresponding media with proper aspect ratio. The level of stability of the images is displayed very well.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
